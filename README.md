ðŸš€This is my small effort to combine technology and one of the most played games of our childhood - "Stone - Paper - Scissor".

âœ¨ The HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is clean and well indented; making it convinient to read.
âœ¨ The JS code has comments to understand the logic.

"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." But what happens when you combine both "work" and "play"? 
For me, this repo happened. 

Thank you for checking this out.
